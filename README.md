A to-do list planner app is a software tool that helps users organize and manage their daily tasks and responsibilities. The app allows users to create a list of tasks, prioritize them, and assign deadlines. Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks on the list and track their progress.

The app usually offers various features such as setting reminders, categorizing tasks, creating subtasks, setting recurring tasks, and adding notes or attachments to tasks. Some apps also provide collaboration features, allowing users to share their to-do lists with others, delegate tasks, and receive notifications when tasks are completed.
